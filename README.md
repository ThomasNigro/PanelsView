PanelsView
==========

This control allows you to have (for the moment) a left panel that appears when you swype from the left to the right. 
I developed it for VLC Windows Phone, and I decided to make it public so people can help me improve it and use it for their projects :)

PS: This is an example of what the PanelsView looks like when you left grid is "opened": http://reho.st/self/6b3438a100c45e3dd689c0516465eca3bd4e1a9f.png
